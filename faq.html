        <dt>Q: Why should I use this app?</dt>
        <dd>A: Electric and hybrid vehicles are faster, safer, and better for the environment. The transportation sector accounts for approximately 30% of total U.S. energy needs and 70% of U.S. petroleum consumption. Using more energy efficient vehicles like hybrid and electric vehicles supports the U.S. economy and helps diversify the U.S. transportation fleet.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How do you recruit the drivers? How can I know that my driver is trustworthy?</dt>
        <dd>A: Our drivers have been meticulously vetted to ensure the safety of our passengers. We have completed background checks to examine motor vehicle recors and criminal history.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How do I request a driver?</dt>
        <dd>A: Simply download our app, then tap a button to begin. Your driver will arrive shortly.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How much does it cost?</dt>
        <dd>A: Since GreenPool is a marketplace for ground-based transportation, the price you pay is based on factors such as distance and availability of drivers. You set the maximum price you’re willing to pay for a given "Green Driver" and then GreenPool matches you with a driver that’s willing to accept your price.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How does it work?</dt>
        <dd>A: Our product is powered by a complex algorithm which efficiently matches idle "Green Drivers" with passengers based on factors such as proximity and shortest time-to-destination. The system is built on a serverless architecture, which makes running and scaling our backend services simple and cost-effective, allowing us to reliably serve the needs of the GreenPool ever growing user base.</dd>
        <dt>Q: What if I have a complaint about my driver?</dt>
        <dd>A: GreenPool is a customer obsessed company. We value each customer and want to ensure a positive experience. Therefore, we’ve staffed our customer service team with serverless chatbots that are available 24/7 to assist you.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How do I cancel my ride?</dt>
        <dd>A: Tap the “Cancel Ride” button in the GreenPool app.</dd>
        <dt>Q: Can I use GreenPool internationally?</dt>
        <dd>A: Yes, you can use GreenPool in most countries except for Antarctica, Cuba, Sudan, Iran, North Korea, Syria and any other country designated by the United States Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How do I pay for my ride?</dt>
        <dd>A: After creating a GreenPool account, fill in your payment method such as credit card, debit card, or even Bitcoin wallet. After you complete your ride, you will automatically be charged the fare.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How many passengers can my driver take?</dt>
        <dd>A: The number of passengers on a single ride depends on the size of the car selected. Most drivers can take between one and four passengers per ride. You can also request a large sized vehicle which can take up to eight passengers. </dd>
        <dt>Q: What if I lose an item during my ride?</dt>
        <dd>A: Drivers can be paid an extra fee to deliver the item to your location depending on the distance.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How do I share my route information with someone else?</dt>
        <dd>A: During your ride, you can share your route and ETA with someone else using the GreenPool app. Simply tap the “Share Route” button and select a contact. Soon, they’ll be able to watch the status of your ride.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How do I rate my driver?</dt>
        <dd>A: After your ride completes, you have the option to rate your driver on the app. Our drivers are customer obsessed and strive for 5 star ratings. Your feedback helps us improve our service!</dd>
        <dt>Q: What if my driver doesn’t match the photo in the app?</dt>
        <dd>A: The driver photo in your app should match the driver that arrives to pick you up. If they do not match, then GreenPool recommends that you do not enter the vehicle. You should then immediately report the imposter unicorn to GreenPool.</dd>
        <dt>Q: Can I use Concur with GreenPool?</dt>
        <dd>A: Yes, you can connect your Concur profile to the GreenPool app so you can track business trips made on GreenPool.</dd>
        <dt>Q: Can I request a specific driver?</dt>
        <dd>A: While we do not allow requesting specific driver, you can choose the type and size of car using the app.</dd>
        <dt>Q: Why do you charge a service fee?</dt>
        <dd>A: The service fee is a fixed charge added to every ride. This helps us pay for our on-going maintenance and operating costs required to run the service and maintain our green approach.</dd>
