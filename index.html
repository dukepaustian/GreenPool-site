      <p class="content">
        In today’s world, the vehicles that aren't hybrid or electric contribute to climate change, air pollution, and rely on finite fossil fuel resources. Wouldn’t it be nice if there were a transportation service that changed the way you get around daily and made a positive impact on the environment? Introducing GreenPool, an innovative transportation service that helps people get to their destination faster with benefits to the environment. Getting started is as easy as tapping a button in our app.

      <p class="content">
        GreenPool was started by an AWS employee, Duke Paustian, who saw an opportunity to make a larger global impact. Duke stumbled upon the GreenPool idea while enjoyinh attending a beautiful vacation to Cannon Beach, OR. After sitting by a fire and enjoying the beautiful views of the Ocean, he recognized the importance of taking action to sustain equisite locations such as that. Moved by the idea that Duke could making a lasting impact, he saw an opportunity to marry society’s demand for faster, more environment friendly transportation to customers through an on-demand market making transportation app. GreenPool was formed and has been lowering carbon emissions ever sinve. Today, GreenPool has thousands of hybrid and electric vehicles in its network fulfilling hundreds of rides each day.
